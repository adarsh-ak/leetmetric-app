Creating a "LeetMatrix" intro project can be an exciting challenge! I'll walk you through a basic version of this project, which involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with API calling to make it dynamic.

The idea behind "LeetMatrix" could be a web page with a cool matrix-like effect, and it fetches data from an API (such as a random quote API or weather API) to make the page more interactive and engaging.

Structure:
HTML - Basic layout.
CSS - Matrix effect and design.
JavaScript - API call and dynamic functionality.
API - I'll use a random quote API to fetch data for our project.
